## Introduction

`xmldoc` lets you parse XML documents with ease. It's a pure-JavaScript, one-file XML document class with a single dependency on the excellent [`sax`][sax] parser.

For more on why I wrote this class, see the [blog post][blog].

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for details (built with [GitHub Changelog Generator](https://skywinder.github.io/github-changelog-generator/)).

## Installation

    npm install xmldoc

Or just download the repository and include it in your `node_modules` directly. Or just download the [single JS file][blob]!

  [blob]: https://github.com/nfarina/xmldoc/blob/master/lib/xmldoc.js

## Installation - React Native

I haven't tested this myself but [installing `buffer` and `stream` separately](https://github.com/nfarina/xmldoc/issues/38) may be necessary for `xmldoc` to work on React Native:

    npm install buffer stream xmldoc

## Usage

```js
var xmldoc = require('xmldoc');

var document = new xmldoc.XmlDocument("<some>xml</some>");

// do things
```

## Classes

The primary exported class is `XmlDocument`, which you'll use to consume your XML text. `XmlDocument` contains a hierarchy of `XmlElement` instances representing the XML structure.

Both `XmlElement` and `XmlDocument` contain the same members and methods you can call to traverse the document or a subtree.

## Members

* `name` - the node name, like "tat" for `<tat>`. XML "namespaces" are ignored by the underlying [sax-js](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) parser, so you'll simply get "office:body" for `<office:body>`.
* `attr` - an object dict containing attribute properties, like `bookNode.attr.title` for `<book title="...">`.
* `val` - the string "value" of the node, if any, like "world" for `<hello>world</hello>`.
* `children` - an array of `XmlElement` children of the node.
* `firstChild`, `lastChild` - pretty much what it sounds like; null if no children
* `line`, `column`, `position`, `startTagPosition` - information about the element's original position in the XML string.

Each member defaults to a sensible "empty" value like `{}` for `attr`, `[]` for `children`, and `""` for `val`.

## Methods

All methods with `child` in the name operate only on direct children; they do not do a deep/recursive search.

It's important to note that `xmldoc` is designed for when you know exactly what you want from your XML file. For instance, it's great for parsing API responses with known structures, but it's not great at teasing things out of HTML documents from the web.

If you need to do lots of searching through your XML document, I highly recommend trying a different library like [node-elementtree](https://github.com/racker/node-elementtree).

### eachChild(func)

Similar to [underscore's][underscore] `each` method, it will call `func(child, index, array)` for each child of the given node.

### childNamed(name)

Pass it the name of a child node and it will search for and return the first one found, or `undefined`.

### childrenNamed(name)

Like `childNamed` but returns all matching children in an array, or `[]`.

### childWithAttribute(name,value)

Searches for the first child with the given attribute value. You can omit `value` to just find the first node with the given attribute defined at all.

### descendantWithPath(path)

Searches for a specific "path" using dot notation. Example:

```xml
<book>
  <author>
    <name isProper="true">George R. R. Martin</name>
    ...
  </author>
  ...
</book>
```

If you just want the `<name>` node and you have the `XmlElement` for the `<book>` node, you can say:

```js
var nameNode = bookNode.descendantWithPath("author.name"); // return <name> node
```

### valueWithPath(path)

Just like `descendantWithPath`, but goes de
